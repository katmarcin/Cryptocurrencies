# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to group cryptocurrencies together to create a classification system and a new investment portofolio for clients of Accountability Accounting. To do so, we created a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market for clients. To group the cryptocurrencies, we used a clustering algorithm with an unsupervised machine learning model. Data visualizations are provided to share findings with the board.
